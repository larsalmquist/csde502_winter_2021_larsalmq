This file tells you that the document of interest is an Rmd file Lars created for CSDE 502's Homework Assignment #4. 
Lars made a number of mistakes in this assignment. 
Loops are confusing in R, however Lars gained a new appreciation for them this week and is grateful for the homework answer key that provides a template for future loops and functions Lars may need to make.
